Makes Chrome start up early and and shut down late, so that apps and extensions can have a longer life.
</p>

<p>
When any installed hosted app, packaged app, or extension has "background" permission, Chrome runs (invisibly) as soon as the user logs into their computer&mdash;before the user launches Chrome. The "background" permission also makes Chrome continue running (even after its last window is closed) until the user explicitly quits Chrome.

<p class="note">
  <b>Note:</b> Disabled apps and extensions are treated as if they aren't installed.
</p>

<p>
You typically use the "background" permission with a <a href="background_pages.html">background page</a>, <a href="event_pages.html">event page</a> or (for hosted apps) a <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/background.html">background window</a>.
